<p>Publishing an App involves some steps - here's a detailed walkthrough.</p><h4>Android</h4><p><strong>1)&nbsp;Build and sign the app</strong></p><p>You first of all need to sign the app. This is a security mechanism that ensures that an APK&nbsp;uploaded to the Google Play Store can clearly be identified.</p><p>You can find step-by-step instructions on how to sign an APK here:&nbsp;<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html" rel="nofollow">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html</a></p><p><strong>2)&nbsp;Release in Google Play Store</strong></p><p>Actually, you can distribute your app via different channels, you can learn more here:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/index.html</a></p><p>But let's focus on the&nbsp;Google Play Store for now.</p><p>First of all, you need a Google developer account. You can sign in or create one when visiting:&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/</a></p><p>This is also the place where you will then upload your app. A developer account costs $25 - but you only pay this once. It's no recurring fee.</p><p>Once you got a developer account, you can create an app in the Google Play console, configure it and upload your APK.</p><p>This is already everything you have to do - feel free to submit your app for review as soon as you're happy with it!&nbsp;:)</p><h4>iOS</h4><p><strong>1)&nbsp;Build your App for production</strong></p><p>As a first step, you need to build your app for production. This involves adjusting the info.plist file and setting up a release build schema in XCode. Detailed instructions can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html#building-your-app-for-production" rel="nofollow">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html#building-your-app-for-production</a></p><p><strong>2)&nbsp;Creating an App and Bundle ID</strong></p><p>Your app requires a bundle id and optionally also an App ID. The latter is only mandatory if you use any special services (e.g. In-App&nbsp;purchases)&nbsp;that requires such an ID. Otherwise, you can use the default wildcard ID.</p><p>If you need or want an App ID, you can create one as described here:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH30-SW991" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH30-SW991</a></p><p>You also need to set a bundle ID&nbsp;in your XCode project (you already get a default one by React Native, feel free to adjust it to your needs though). You can learn more about setting a bundle ID&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH28-SW16" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH28-SW16</a></p><p><strong>3)&nbsp;Create an App on iTunes Connect</strong></p><p>Comparable to the Google Play Console, you also need to create an app on iTunes Connect:&nbsp;<a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">https://itunesconnect.apple.com/</a></p><p>Make sure to use the same bundle ID&nbsp;as you chose in XCode.</p><p>Once all is configured there, you can deploy your app from XCode.</p><p><strong>4)&nbsp;Deploying the App from XCode</strong></p><p>To deploy an App from XCode (and therefore your machine)&nbsp;to your project/&nbsp;App on iTunes connect, you use XCode. There, you first of all need to create an archive.</p><p>An archive is created by running "Product"&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;"Archive" in XCode.</p><p>Once the archive was created, the archive explorer should open.&nbsp;In there, you can upload the app to iTunes connect.</p><p>You can read more about the process here:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/UploadingYourApptoiTunesConnect/UploadingYourApptoiTunesConnect.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH36-SW2" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/UploadingYourApptoiTunesConnect/UploadingYourApptoiTunesConnect.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH36-SW2</a></p>
